# PyI-OI
The main goal of this project is to build the functions about daily computer works, make all jobs more efficiency. In addition, we hope the function of file read/write and data plot can help the people who need statistics analysis.
## Getting Started
Before use these class functions, we need to install some python plugins by instructions as follow, and the environment of mine is ubuntu 14.04LTS, pyhton 2.7.
```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
```
### Installing
Install the plugins for reading and writting excel file.
```
$ sudo pip install xlrd xlwt
```
Because xlwt is only support excel 2003, so we need to install xlsxwritter.
```
$ sudo pip install xlsxwriter
```
Install matplotlib for plotting statistics graph.
```
$ sudo pip install matplotlib
$ sudo apt-get install python-tk
```
